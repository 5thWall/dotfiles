# Dotfiles

These are my dotfiles. Yay dotfiles!

## Notes
 * I'm using [hub](https://github.com/defunkt/hub) as a wrapper for git.
  - Github username and token are set in `~/.ghub` (called by `bashrc`)
 * I'm using [ls++](https://github.com/trapd00r/ls--) as a replacement for `ls`
 * I have [fasd](https://github.com/clvv/fasd) installed
